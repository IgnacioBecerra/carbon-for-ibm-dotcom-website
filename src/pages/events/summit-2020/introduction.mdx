## Our vision

As we accelerate IBM's digital transformation, we have a unique opportunity to reimagine and rebuild how our users use IBM.com and get their jobs done. And to achieve this goal, we have the new IBM Design Langauage, Carbon Design System, IBM.com Library, and the corporate-wide initiatives to support this work. This summit is to share the latest, and align ourselves to the future of IBM.com.

## Background

IBM has centralized on the Carbon Design System for both product offerings and all web experiences in support of the company's ongoing transformation towards human-centric and holistic journeys that both solve client problems and deliver business results. 

Built on the award winning IBM Design Language, Carbon is an open source set of design affordances and pre-built code that helps makers quickly build and deploy world class web pages for IBM.com. With reusable components and production-tested code, Carbon is ready for widespread scaling across all web properties at the company. We recognize that not all teams have already completed this journey towards Carbon, and this Summit will  guide attendees towards accelerating the adoption of the system. 


## Who is it for

This summit to open to select makers of core IBM.com experiences and platforms&mdash;primarily offering managers, design leaders, and development leaders.
