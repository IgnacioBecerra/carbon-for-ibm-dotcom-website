As we accelerate IBM's digital transformation, we have a unique opportunity to reimagine and rebuild how our users use IBM.com and get their jobs done. And to achieve this goal, we have the new IBM Design Langauage, Carbon Design System, IBM.com Library, as well as some of the core corporate-wide initiatives. This summit is to share the latest, and align ourselves to the future of IBM.com.
