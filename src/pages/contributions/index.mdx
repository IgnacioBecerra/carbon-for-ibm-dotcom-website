## Introduction

**Carbon for IBM.com** has been created to help IBM.com makers design and build web pages and digital experiences on IBM.com. It is an active community that continues to grow and evolve with the help of contributors. 

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, tested designs, and recommended patterns. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new?labels=question&template=question.md)
- [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new?assignees=jeffchew%2C+wonilsuhibm%2C&labels=Feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=)  

## Working in the open

**Carbon for IBM.com** lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments can be viewed on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom).

If there is something that you do not see here, or if you notice something that could be improved, you have two options:

1. **Open a feature request.** We’ll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we’ll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for requests, but we’ll do our best to give you a reasonable estimate.

2. **Take up the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon for IBM.com.** We appreciate complete contributions. You’re welcome to open a pull request to submit your work, and we’ll review and inform you as we decide.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the process.
