<PageDescription>

IBM.com is a place for people to learn about, try, and buy IBM products, solutions, and services. Visitors to IBM.com deserve to have an efficient and delightful experience while on their journey.

</PageDescription>

<PageDescription>

Towards that end, IBM.com Library has been built with the goal of providing efficiency and consistency across IBM.com using IBM Design Language (IDL) principles and based on the Carbon Design System (Carbon). IBM.com Library is focused on supporting IBM.com applications and/or website owners who are planning to adopt IDL and need specific capabilities relevant to IBM.com.

## What is included in IBM.com Library?
IBM.com Library includes the following:

* Components: usage guidelines and code (e.g. Masthead and/or Footer)
* Patterns: usage guidelines (e.g. Lead Space)
* Services and utilities (e.g. required Tealium)
* Implementation guidelines 
* Design kits in Sketch
* Code in Storybook (Accessibility tested)
* Resources for React and non-React adopters 

## How to decide the right path for adoption

### For pages produced and published in Marketing Platform's CMS:
Carbon will be made available through Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) in 2021. 

For more information, please go to [Project Afterburner](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/adobe/).

In the interim, while the migration from Drupal to AEM is underway, page owners can use page specific Design Guidelines to configure existing pages to have the look and feel of IBM Design Language. 

For more information, please visit [Marketing Platforms Drupal CMS website](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/squad-pulse/marketing-platforms/drupal-cms#Links).

### For websites or applications on v18 (Northstar), v19a, or earlier, make plans now to migrate your site to Carbon using the IBM.com Library.  Older design systems will be sunset at the end of 2021.  
This site explains how to get started with IBM.com Library. It provides links to the code repository, the storybook, usage guidelines, and additional resources for getting started. Keep in mind the following things as you get started:

* Carbon and the IBM.com Library are built using Node Package Manager (NPM), not the Content Delivery Network (CDN), so it requires a complete rewrite, unlike prior design systems.
* Carbon has a new 2x grid so everything needs to be designed understanding that grid.
* It is open source, so anyone is invited to make contributions to the Library.

To assist IBM adopters through this transition, the Digital Design Squad can help with getting started or perform a design review and a final code review. Reach out on our slack channel at [#ibm-digital-design](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6).
